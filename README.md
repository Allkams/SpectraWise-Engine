# SpectraWise-Engine
This rendering engine is created using C++20, OpenGL, and managed with CMake. It is being developed as a YouTube series focused on learning the intricacies of rendering techniques. I invite you to follow along and witness the progress that will be achieved!

## Requirements
- Cmake 3.2+
- Compiler that runs C++20

## Personal Usage Info
If you want to use this engine to build a game or just play around, your free to do!

### Instructions
To make a game or a rendering project you need to add your code in a folder inside of [projects](/projects). This new folder must include its own CMakeList.txt file, which will generate the project and solution. Execute CMake from the root directory, and subsequently open the solution in your intended destination folder.

## Bug Reporting
